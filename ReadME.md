# How to run the API

### Step 1. Fork and clone the project onto your computer
### Step 2. Double click the solution file to open in Visual Studios Community (Visual Studios must already be installed!)
### Step 3. Click the down arrow next to the green triangle (the run button) and choose the Kestral option (not IIS)
### Step 4. Once you have chosen the Kestral Server Option (it should say Mock_BestBuy_API next to the green triangle) run the API

#### If you followed all the steps above, then you should see a browser full of JSON.
