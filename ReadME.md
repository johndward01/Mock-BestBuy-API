# How to run the API

- Fork and clone the project onto your computer
- Double click the solution file to open in Visual Studios Community (Visual Studios must already be installed!)
- Click the down arrow next to the green triangle (the run button) and choose the Kestral option (not IIS)
- Once you have chosen the Kestral Server Option (it should say Mock_BestBuy_API next to the green triangle) run the API

### If you followed all the steps above, then you should see a browser full of JSON. 

### **Use Postman to help you query the API!**
