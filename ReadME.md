# How to run the API

### - Fork and clone the project onto your computer
### - Double click the solution file to open in Visual Studios Community 
### - You must add an appsettings.json file with your **connection string**
### - Once you've correctly added it and called it in your Startup.cs file, you are ready to run the app.
### - Click the down arrow next to the green triangle (the run button) and choose the Kestral option (not IIS)
### - Once you have chosen the Kestral Server Option (it should say Mock_BestBuy_API next to the green triangle) run the API

> If you followed all the steps above, then you should see a browser full of JSON. 

> **Use Postman to help you query the API!**
